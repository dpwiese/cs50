## CS50 CSS Seminar

* CSS see slides from seminar
* [paletton.com](http://paletton.com) color scheme designer
* Class and id are attributes

```css
SELECTOR {
    rule
}
```

* Class = "special pretty" // two classes, it belongs to both classes.
* If there are conflicts -- CASCADING.
* The rules override each other
* It doesnt matter what the order is when you give the attributes in html, it only matters the order of the selectors in the CSS stylesheet
* Things that only apply to things with BOTH attribute special and pretty `.special.pretty`
* "select all of the children within the parent" `body.navbar.button`
* When we put spaces between the selectors it's things within first but not in second.
* Within first tag, where are second tag?
* Within secial, things that are special, and then within those, also pretty `.special .pretty`
* Box model
* 1em = the height of your font that you are using
