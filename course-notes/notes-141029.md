# CS50 Lecture Notes 29-October-2014

* End of week 8
* PhP
* Web server vs web programming
* Takes http requests and respond
* Server needs to interpret php files before serving them up

```php
// superglobals
$_COOKIE
$_GET
$_POST
$_SESSION - like shopping cart, how many times we visited page
S_SERVER - lower level details of server
$_FILES
```

* Inside of the superglobal get are the variables we put in the query string
* These are all associative arrays - data structure associating keys with values
* Cookie - piece of data that a server puts on your computer, to remember who you are. A digital handstamp that indicates you have been here before. been identified/authenticated
* In chrome dev tools: `Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=0v...`
* The name of key is `PHPSESSID` with value `0v...`
* `path=/` means cookie associated with whole website, not just a specific page
* When visiting a second time now it says `Cookie: PHPSESSID=0v...` instead of `Set-Cookie`
* This is stored in `$_SESSION`
* Many websites won't work without cookies
* We need a better way than email to keep data: use SQL
* SQL is a language we use to talk to database: essentially a relational database
* With SQL and actual databases: use language to search, insert, etc data

```sql
-- SQL:
DELETE
INSERT
UPDATE
SELECT
```

* SQL operates entirely on rows
* phpMyAdmin is a tool to interact graphical user interface with SQL
* Each worksheet in excel is a table

```sql
-- * represents all columns
-- The back-tick is only used when talking about names of tables or fields
SELECT * FROM `users`
```

* Says select everything

```sql
DELETE FROM `users` WHERE username = "zamyla"

INSERT INTO `users` (username, hash) VALUES('gabe','TODO')
```

* `gabe`s ID automatically assigned to increment ID number
* Design decision: what data type to use

```
CHAR
VARCHAR
INT
```

* create table
* A_I auto increment

* Storage engines
  * InnoDB
  * MyISAM
  * ..
* In templates (V in MVC): header and footer
* ? is placeholder for string
* Wwitch cases in php takes strings not just chars
